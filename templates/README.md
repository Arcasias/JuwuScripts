# Scripts

Couldn't bother to find a more fitting name for this repo, because that's all there is: scripts.

This repository is a list of small scripts/projects that I like to use accross the Web. Feel free to use any of them (at your own risks) and also to report issues/suggestions if you have any.

## How to use

You will first need to open the console (<code style="color:#a8f">F12</code>). Then there are 3 scenarios:

1. The script is <b style="color:#4c4">inline</b> (no <b style="color:#c80">function</b> definition): you can then simply paste the code, press <code style="color:#a8f">Enter</code> and close the console. This should do the trick.

2. The script defines a <b style="color:#c80">function</b> that you can call with the desired <b style="color:#cb0">arguments</b> (there should be enought doc on each script to know what arguments you can use).

3. The script defines something else, which should be specified by the script description.
